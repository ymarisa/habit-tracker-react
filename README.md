Mark off days that don't count against your goal, they will show as striped.

Click a week to view from the picker at the bottom.

### Future
* refactor css files, move component specific elements out of app.css
* fetch data from dailylog api
* update dailylog with input from this app
* add/remove habits for main grid
* use a better date library
* work for varying number of habits, with varying numbers of records
* fix hard coded data

## Known Issues
* onclick events are not working or hooked up
    * main grid does not show summaries
    * picker does not allow choosing a new week
* `picker-label` isn't working
    * onmouseover shows box to select week but not date labels
